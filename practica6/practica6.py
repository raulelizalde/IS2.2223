#   findClosestCentroids(X, centroids) returns the index of the closest 
#   centroids for a dataset X where each row is a single example.

#   (i.e., each entry in range [0..k-1])

    # Instructions: Go over every example, find its closest centroid, and store
    #               the index inside idx at the appropriate location.
    #               Concretely, idx[i] should contain the index of the centroid
    #               closest to example i. Hence, it should be a value in the 
    #               range 0..k-1. You may find useful np.argmin()
    #
    # Note: You can use a for-loop over the examples to compute this.

#   example, and k, the number of centroids. You should return a matrix of
#   centroids, where each row of centroids is the mean of the data points
#   assigned to it.

#   the total number of interactions of k-Means to execute. runkMeans returns
